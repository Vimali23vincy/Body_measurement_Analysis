# **Body Measurements Analysis**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes body measurement data from the **NHANES dataset**, focusing on **adult male and female individuals**.  
The goal is to explore, visualize, and statistically analyze various body metrics such as:

- Weight  
- Height  
- Arm circumference  
- Waist circumference  
- Thigh circumference  

The analysis includes **data visualization**, **descriptive statistics**, and **comparative analysis** between genders.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
This project is implemented using **Python** with the following libraries:

- **NumPy** → Numerical operations  
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** → Visualization  
- **Seaborn** → Advanced statistical plotting  
- **SciPy** → Statistical analysis

---

## 🚀 Features
- Load and clean male and female datasets.
- Visualize distributions of body measurements using **histograms** and **boxplots**.
- Compare male vs. female metrics using **side-by-side plots**.
- Calculate key **statistical measures**:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Standard Deviation
  - Variance
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
- Provide interpretations of results.

## 📊 Analysis Performed
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Read male and female datasets into pandas DataFrames.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Histograms for weight distributions.  
   - Boxplots to compare male vs. female measurements.  

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for both genders.  
   - Detection of skewness and kurtosis to understand data distribution.  

4. **Visualization Insights**  
   - Clear visual representation of gender-based differences in measurements.
